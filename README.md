# nufast

Cargo crate containing Rust port of the NuFast neutrino oscillation probability code.

## features

- compute eigenvalues in vacuum/matter
- compute mixing angles in vacuum/matter
- compute pmns in vacuum/matter
- compute hamiltonian in vacuum/matter
- compute probabilities in vacuum/matter

## todo

- write functions to compute eigenvalues
- write functions to compute mixing angles
- look at pytrino code and use that
